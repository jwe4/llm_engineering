Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

It argues that the Holocaust has become a cornerstone of a civil religion stemming from the Post-War Consensus, where questions about its sacredness are treated as heresy. The piece highlights how this system enforces rigid orthodoxy, discourages inquiry into motives, and demands excommunication for dissenters, illustrating a broader trend of moral and cultural sacralization. It criticizes how secular institutions and Christian responses have often conflated history with religious dogma, leading to a climate where questioning foundational narratives threatens their authority. The article calls Christians to recognize these patterns and discern between true remembrance and idolatry, emphasizing that only Christ’s truth can withstand such religious safeguards."

    "The backlash against pastor Joel Webbon for suggesting that Holocaust teaching now functions like a religion revealed more than his critics intended. The speed of the outrage and the calls for excommunication exposed a system that does not answer questions with argument, but with punishment. That is not how history operates. It is how creeds operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article argues that the Holocaust has become the moral cornerstone of the Post-War Consensus, a civil religion that has shaped the West since 1945. Within that system, the Holocaust functions as original sin, the Allied victory as redemption, and post-war institutions as guardians of salvation. Questioning that framework is treated as heresy because it threatens the authority of the entire order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians, trained to recognize counterfeit gospels, should have noticed this immediately. Many did not. The Webbon episode exposes how deeply the Post-War Consensus has catechized the church, and why discernment is now more necessary than ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every civilization has moments it remembers, and every civilization eventually chooses which moments it is no longer allowed to examine. The transition is subtle. At first, the event is taught as history. Later, it is taught as moral instruction. Finally, it is taught as identity itself. Once that transition is complete, the event no longer functions as history at all. It becomes religious infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A days weeks ago, pastor Joel Webbon was attacked by a Temu version of Media Matters for making an observation that should not have been controversial in a free society and certainly should not have been incomprehensible to Christians. He suggested that Holocaust teaching in the modern West has taken on the characteristics of a religion. He did not deny the event, minimize suffering, or dispute certain details He observed that the way the Holocaust is taught, protected, ritualized, and enforced now resembles a sacred system rather than a historical one.\n",
    "\n",
    "He didn’t stumble into a historical dispute, when he uttered the lines that RightWingWatch would use to cut from context and disseminate to the outrage mob. He brushed against a sacred boundary. The reaction was not disagreement, correction, or counterargument. It was denunciation, moral alarm, and calls for ecclesiastical expulsion and excommunication. And that makes sense, because when history becomes religious creed, that produces outrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the clearest markers of religious catechism is rigidity. In ordinary scholarship, approximation is normal. Estimates vary, language shifts, emphasis differs. In catechism, precision is not about clarity but loyalty. The answer must be recited correctly and precisely, not because other answers are false, but because deviation signals rebellion against the religious order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians understand this instinctively. We were raised on questions that demand fixed responses. What is justification? What is the chief end of man? What is the purpose of God’s law? The point is not that paraphrase is impossible, but that catechesis is designed to bind a community together through shared language. The words matter because the words signal membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s why when asked how many Jews died in the Holocaust you aren’t permitted to say a bunch, or millions, or almost six million. You must say six million. Anything less is heresy. It’s holocaust denialism, and that’s a venial sin. And that’s because it’s become a religion. But that’s just one religion undertone that’s developed among many.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "IF YOU PREFER TO LISTEN ON SPOTIFY, CLICK HERE\n",
    "ORIGINAL SIN WITHOUT ATONEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Every religion has a doctrine of guilt. The only question is whether it has a doctrine of redemption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Christianity, guilt is named clearly and traced honestly. It is universal, inherited, and inescapable. But it is also resolved somehow, on the cross. The entire system turns on the claim that guilt does not persist forever if atonement is offered for it. It is absorbed, answered, and propitiated, with God’s wrath ultimately extinguished. The cross is not an ongoing accusation but a finished verdict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Civil religion does the opposite. It names guilt, then preserves it because guilt is very important to accomplishing the desired political goals. It teaches moral inheritance without moral resolution. The past becomes a permanent stain on the present. The only reason reparations haven’t gained more favor is because it would signal that some debts could be paid, which defeats the purpose of the entire exercise. Responsibility and blame must go on forever. Penance is perpetual.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where modern Holocaust pedagogy quietly departs from historical instruction and enters theological space. The event is not simply remembered, but it is transmuted into a standing moral debt that must be serviced indefinitely, and imputed to anyone who doesn’t follow the religious rules set forth. Political loyalty, foreign policy alignment, financial support, and rhetorical obedience become ways of proving that the debt is still being honored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not how history operates. But, it is how sacralized guilt operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Share\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians should notice the structural inversion immediately. A system that teaches inherited moral obligation without closure is not merely educational. It is eschatological. It has an end times vision, but no final judgment. The work of holocaust memorialism is never done. It’s useful in literally every single political discussion. The threat is never past. It must be brought up endlessly and in every conversation, and settle every dispute. It’s doctrine, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slogan “never again” functions less like a lesson and more like a creed. It does not point forward to restoration. It points sideways to perpetual management. Salvation is no longer something accomplished. It is something administered gradually, so long as people go along with whatever political action we are told best memorializes the Holocaust and best prevents another. Truth or positional correctness takes back-seat to stopping the next Holocaust that we are told is just around the corner if people express inappropriate opinions or have un-authorized thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY “WHY” IS FORBIDDEN\n",
    "\n",
    "Another unmistakable marker of religious sacralization is the prohibition on motive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every other historical atrocity, the first task of the historian is explanation. Causes are examined. Conditions are weighed. Ideologies are traced. Institutional failures are identified. None of this is understood as sympathy. It is understood as the responsibility of historians. If you do not understand why something happened, you cannot prevent it from happening again, obviously. But that’s not how it works with the Holocaust at all. Instead, historians are tasked as the guardians of society, making sure no one goes back down the coridoors of time without a permit - almost never issued - for fear of what might be found there. No, the job of historians in regard to the Holocaust is to gate-keep any such historical explanations, or else another Holocaust is right around the corner. The canon of history was shut about a decade after the war ended (by the victors), and any attempt to open it again is treated with contempt. It’s similar to the way that the Roman Catholic Church has made historic claims but doesn’t exactly break out the relics for investigation. Just trust them, because that’s really a vial of Mary’s breast milk and that’s all there is to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With religious events, explanation itself becomes suspect. Asking why is treated as an act of aggression against the faith. Structural analysis is framed as excuse. Context is treated as contamination. Evil must remain abstract or the entire moral architecture that was erected immediately following WWII begins to wobble.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not how Scripture handles evil. Scripture names wickedness without hesitation, but it never refuses to analyze it. Pharaoh is not simply called evil. His heart is hardened through pride, fear, and power. Babylon is not merely condemned. Its economic, religious, and political structures are exposed. Rome is not reduced to a monster. It is dissected as an empire that worships force and order. In the last 20 years, no shortage of essays, articles, and books have hypothesized why Judas betrayed Christ. Was it greed, or was he trying to force Christ into a Maccabee-style insurrection to become a political Messiah? You get the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christian theology does not fear explanation because it does not fear truth. False systems fear explanation because they’re built on lies or twisted truths.\n",

    "When a society forbids “why,” it is not protecting victims. It is protecting a narrative. It is protecting the system that has grown up around the narrative. That system depends on moral clarity without intellectual clarity, and it cannot survive sustained inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the reaction to Webbon mattered. He did not deny an event. He noticed a pattern that suggests a religion was forming. The response was not to correct his claim but to punish his observation and declare him a heretic (as aspiring evangelical influencers, Joe Boot and James White, literally charged him) with obvious religious zeal.

    "The most revealing moment in the Webbon controversy was not the criticism itself. It was the demand for ecclesiastical discipline, shunning, and excommunication. Secular activists and ideological watchdogs merely denounced him, sort of a case-in-point, “Here’s what those crazy conservatives are saying today” type thing. But the self-appointed Sanhedrin of Concerned Evangelicals™ called for his removal from ministry. They demanded excommunication.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not church members appealing to elders. These are not theologians correcting doctrine. These are outsiders invoking religious penalties to enforce compliance with a civil taboo. They deny being a religion while demanding the church act as their enforcement arm. It’s pretty crazy to watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-appointed gurus of Internet Apologetics saw the RightWingWatch clip and instead of evaluating Webbon’s claims, they instinctively thought, “Oh, good. We can attack our enemy with this.” And they did so while they should have acknowledged on the credibility of limited expertise that “Yes, in fact, the Holocaust is taking on religious undertones.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Leave a comment\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians have seen this before. Empires have always tried to harness the church’s disciplinary mechanisms for their own purposes. The novelty here is that the demand comes from people who insist no religion is involved. They want the punishment without the confession, the banishment without the creed. The irony is thick enough to butter toast with.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this episode especially embarrassing for the religious class is that they played along. Pastors and commentators rushed to distance themselves, to signal compliance, to assure the watching world that they too recognized the violation of decorum. Very few stopped to ask why a sociological observation had triggered a call for religious banishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "That failure is not primarily intellectual. It is spiritual. Christians are trained to recognize false gospels, counterfeit righteousness, and borrowed moral authority. They are supposed to be alert to systems that demand loyalty while denying grace. Instead, many joined the chorus, mistaking fear for faithfulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Holocaust were functioning only as history, the response would have been historical. Evidence would have been marshaled. Pedagogical intent would have been explained. Claims would have been weighed. Instead, the response took the form reserved for blasphemy. Webbon was not treated as mistaken. He was treated as dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what religious systems do when touched at the nerve. They do not debate. They guard. They do not persuade. They enforce. The people who reacted most strongly were not defending facts, but policing a boundary that must not be crossed if the moral order is to remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes the episode almost comical is that the reaction did more to validate Webbon’s claim than any argument he could have offered. If you want to convince people that something has become religious, demand excommunication when someone notices it. Nothing proves the point faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The irony should not be missed. These are men who will spend hours policing doctrinal language, warning against imprecision, and dissecting sermons line by line. They will warn young men about therapeutic moralism, cultural Marxism (minus explanation about who started it), and progressive Christianity. But when a civil religion demands obedience, they fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because discernment is costly when it cuts against the grain of the age. It is easier to critique fringe movements than to question the moral architecture that props up respectable power. It is easier to spot false teaching in a church plant than to recognize catechesis coming from museums, media, and public education.\n",
    "\n",
    "The religious class has grown accustomed to guarding the edges while ignoring the center. They know how to fight small errors but have lost the nerve to question foundational assumptions. As a result, they enforce boundaries they did not establish and defend taboos they did not examine.\n",

    "ZEAL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE, DISCIPLINE WITHOUT SHEPHERDING\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most revealing aspects of the reaction to Webbon was how quickly the language of discipline appeared. Calls for removal, condemnation, and separation came easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Church discipline is a serious thing. It exists for the protection of doctrine and the restoration of sinners. It is meant to be exercised by elders who know their flock and understand the difference between error and rebellion. When discipline is invoked as a signaling mechanism to satisfy outside outrage, it ceases to be discipline at all. It becomes theater. What happened here was not shepherding, but cultural appeasement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand was not that Webbon repent of sin. It was that he retract an observation. Sin calls for repentance. Observation calls for discussion. When observation is treated as sin, the system has already decided that certain thoughts are forbidden regardless of intent or accuracy. And this is exactly how civil religions maintain order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians who participate in this process are not being discerning. They are being useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNOWING THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES\n",
    "\n",
    "Jesus rebuked the religious leaders of His day for being able to read the weather but not the moment they were living in. He accused them of blindness, not ignorance. They knew Scripture. They knew tradition. They simply failed to recognize how power was operating in front of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That warning applies here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are living in a moment when secular systems increasingly demand religious loyalty while denying religious status. They insist on moral conformity, enforce linguistic precision, punish heresy, and demand sacrifice, all while claiming neutrality. Christians who cannot recognize that pattern are not cautious. They are asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Webbon episode was a test, and many failed it. Not because they denied Christ, but because they could not tell the difference between the Gospel and a rival creed. They mistook moral panic for righteousness and enforcement for truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a call to deny history. It is a call to refuse idolatry. Christians are commanded to remember truthfully, to honor the dead, and to pursue justice. They are not commanded to uphold a civil religion that replaces grace with memory and redemption with management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians should be grateful to live in a time when these things are visible. The exposure is a mercy. False gods always demand silence. They always demand sacrifice. They always reveal themselves eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE BIGGER PICTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the reaction to Joel Webbon was so swift and so hysterical is not because the Holocaust stands alone. It is because it sits at the center of a much larger religious system that has governed the West since 1945. The Holocaust is not merely remembered within that system. It functions as the original sin that explains everything that followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Christians often miss is that the Post-War Consensus is not simply an agreement about foreign policy or international cooperation. It is a moral cosmology. It tells a story about the fall of man, the redemption of civilization, and the institutions that must be obeyed if the world is to remain saved. The Holocaust is the catastrophe that gives the story its authority. The Allied victory is the redemptive act. Everything after that is downstream theology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why certain institutions are treated as sacred. NATO is not defended on the basis of prudence or success. It is defended as a guardian of peace. The United Nations is not evaluated by its fruit. It is assumed to be indispensable. Global finance is not weighed against local harm. It is justified as stabilizing the world. These things are not debated as policies. They are defended as pillars holding up the moral order born out of 1945.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that framework is understood, the Webbon episode makes perfect sense. Questioning the religious function of Holocaust pedagogy does not merely challenge an educational approach. It threatens the entire moral narrative that justifies the post-war world. If the Holocaust can be discussed as history rather than sacred trauma, then the authority it grants to the post-war order weakens. If that authority weakens, then the institutions built on it must answer for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why the system cannot tolerate analysis. It does not fear denial. It fears desacralization.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE SAINTS, THE REDEEMERS, AND THE UNTOUCHABLES\n",
    "\n",
    "Every religion has its saints, and the Post-War Consensus is no exception. The men who presided over the Allied victory are not treated as statesmen who made hard choices under pressure. They are treated as redeemers of civilization. Churchill, Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower are insulated from moral scrutiny in ways no other political figures enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their decisions are not weighed in proportion. Their failures are reframed as necessities. Their atrocities are explained away as tragic but unavoidable. To question them is to violate the creed. To suggest that they acted with cruelty or recklessness is to commit heresy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why conservative Christians, who would never tolerate hagiography in church history, suddenly bristle when war leaders are examined honestly. They can dissect Augustine, Calvin, or Luther without flinching, but become defensive the moment someone questions Churchill or Nagasaki. They have learned, often without realizing it, which saints may not be touched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Holocaust plays a crucial role here. It functions as the justification for absolution. Because the enemy was absolute evil, the redeemers must be treated as absolute good. Once that logic is accepted, moral inquiry becomes dangerous. If the redeemers are sinners like everyone else, then the redemption narrative collapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not history. It is theology.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS DEFEND WHAT THEY SHOULD QUESTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the Post-War Consensus is how deeply it has catechized conservative Christians. These are people who pride themselves on skepticism toward media, government, and academia. They know propaganda exists. They know narratives are constructed. Yet when it comes to the post-war story, they suddenly insist that everything is settled.\n",
    "\n",
    "They will defend Harry Truman with more passion than they defend the sanctity of life. They will bristle at criticism of Nagasaki more than they bristle at open mockery of Christ. They will accuse fellow Christians of moral depravity for asking questions they would ask about any other war.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is simple. They have mistaken the Consensus for reality itself. It is not something they believe. It is something they inhabit. It is the air they breathe. Challenging it feels like destabilizing the world, not revising an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the Holocaust occupies such a powerful place within the system. It anchors the entire moral universe. If that anchor is loosened, everything else must be justified on its own merits. Institutions must answer for their failures. Wars must be weighed honestly. Power must be restrained rather than sanctified.\n",
    "\n",
    "That prospect terrifies people who have confused moral order with moral narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY THIS MATTERS NOW\n",
    "\n",
    "The Post-War Consensus is aging. Its institutions are failing. Its promises ring hollow. Yet its moral authority remains fiercely guarded, because without that authority the system has nothing left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christians should be the first to recognize this moment. They know what false gospels look like. They know what happens when history is turned into creed and power is baptized as righteousness. They know that any competing system of religion demanding loyalty without question is ultimately hostile to the Gospel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tragedy is not that secular institutions behave religiously. The tragedy is that the church often cannot tell the difference anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why controversies like this matter. They force the issue into the open. They reveal who is enforcing which creed, and at what cost. They remind us that remembering truthfully is not the same thing as worshiping history, and that honoring victims does not require surrendering discernment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christ alone is King. Every other order, no matter how loudly it invokes moral necessity, must answer to that truth.\n",
